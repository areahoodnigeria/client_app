                AreaHood was born from a simple observation: while technology
                has connected the world, it has often disconnected us from our
                immediate neighbors. We believe that strong, connected
                neighborhoods are the foundation of thriving communities and
                happier lives.
              </p>
              <p className="text-lg text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
                Our platform brings neighbors together through local events,
                shared resources, safety alerts, and meaningful connections that
                create lasting bonds and stronger communities.

                  <p>
                    AreaHood started in 2020 when our founder, Sarah Johnson,
                    moved to a new neighborhood during the pandemic. Despite
                    living in a bustling city, she felt isolated and
                    disconnected from her immediate community.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    She realized that while social media connected us globally,
                    there was no effective way to connect with the people living
                    just steps away. This gap inspired the creation of AreaHood.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Today, AreaHood serves over 500 communities across 50+
                    cities, helping neighbors organize events, share resources,
                    stay safe, and build the kind of connected communities that
                    make neighborhoods feel like home.
